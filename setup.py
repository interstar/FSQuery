Working with the file system is too verbose. 
      
FSQuery provides a way of thinking about the file system inspired by JQuery.
      
An FSQuery is created from a particular director with a number of terms added as modifiers. 
      
A simple example : 
      
    from fsquery import FSQuery
    
    fsq = FSQuery("/home/myaccount").NoFollow(".git").Ext(".py").FileOnly()
    for n in fsq :
        print(n.abs)
      

This FSQuery searches all directories under /home/myaccount, except directories with ".git" in their name.

It matches files with a ".py" extension. And the FileOnly() suppresses returning directories.
